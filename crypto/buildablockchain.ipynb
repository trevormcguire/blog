    "## Hashing\n",
    "\n",
    "At the foundation of any blockchain is the concept of hashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "A hash function takes in data of any size and maps it to fixed-size values. You can think of these functions as \"data-scramblers\" that assign seemingly random and unique values to any data. I say *seemingly* because in reality, the values aren't actually random. However, for our purposes, we will be focusing on hash functions that utilize an extremely large pool of values to produce their output. And the size of this pool make it highly unlikely that the hash function will produce the same value for any two distinct inputs. However, when this does occur, it is called a *hash collision*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Technically, the output of a hash function is called a **digest**, although many refer to this output as simply the **hash**. In this article, I will use these terms interchangably. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different hash functions out there. For example, Bitcoin uses two consecutive rounds of sha256, while Ethereum uses keccak256. That being said, the important thing to remember is that these hash functions are different means to the same end--that is, they provide a predictable (but seemingly random) output for any input. \n",
    "\n",
    "The type of hash functions we are concerned with are cryptographic hash functions. Generally, these are hash functions that satisfy the following:\n",
    "1. The same input will produce the same output\n",
    "2. Given an output, it is infeasible to obtain the input (except by brute-force trial-and-error over a collasal number of iterations)\n",
    "3. Given two unique inputs, the probability of a hash collision is basically zero\n",
    "4. Any minor change in the input will produce vastly different results\n",
    "5. Computationally fast to produce\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To put things in perspective (in regards to point number 3 above), the probability of a hash collision for sha256 is 4.3^10-60. And Bitcoin uses two rounds of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we’ve discussed, blockchains make use of cryptographic hash functions, which are hash functions that are extremely hard to reverse. Meaning, if we’re given a hash, it’s unfeasibly difficult (on a supercomputing level) to ever guess what the input was"

    "The Proof-of-Work algorithm dates back to the early 90s and was originally used to prevent denial-of-service attacks. The idea behind the algorithm is straightforward: produce a hash value that satisfies some constraint.\n",

    "In Bitcoin, the Proof-of-Work algorithm used is called Hashcash, and was developed by Adam Back in 1997 for email spam protection. \n",
    "The idea was to only accept emails that had a hash value below a certain number. This sounds pretty simple, but when considering that cryptographic hash functions produce a completely \"random\" number for a given input, one can start to see why this is effective. In fact, the only real way to satisfy this constraint is to insert arbitrary data, hash it, and then hope for the best. This process is done countless times until the value of the hash is less than the target number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets simulate this. Below, I wrote a fake email and defined a target number equal to 1 million. In order for my email to be considered \"not spam\", the integer value of its hash must be less than this target number. To accomplish this, we iteratively append random values until this constraint is met. Note that the hash function used here is Shake-128, which lets you choose its output size.  "
